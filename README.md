# entrez-rs

## A Rust wrapper around the Entrez API 

![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Zenleaf/entrez-rs.svg?branch=master)

This library helps you access the Entrez API using idiomatic Rust.
It also provides tools to parse the XML results from Entrez.

Currently in alpha stage. Can access Pubmed articles so far.

Will add a walkthrough and tutorial of the API as soon as it reaches beta level.

Inspired by Entrez Direct, Entrezpy and BioPython.
